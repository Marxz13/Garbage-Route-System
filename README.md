<h1>Garbage Truck Route Management System</h1>

A sophisticated routing system developed in C++ designed to optimize garbage collection routes for municipal services.
Utilizing Dijkstra's, A*, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms, the system offers efficient pathfinding solutions to minimize travel time and operational costs. By comparing these algorithms, 
GTRAMS provides tailored route planning that adapts to different urban layouts and traffic conditions. 
This system not only enhances the efficiency of garbage collection services but also contributes to reduced environmental impact through optimized route selection.
